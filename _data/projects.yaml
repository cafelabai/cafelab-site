    Large language models (LLM) represent a new and rapidly changing technological advancement for K12 STEM learning. It is critical at this point in time to investigate and provide pathways for including justice, equity, inclusion, and community cultural capital and wealth in designing LLM-based educational systems. In the context of developing an AI chatbot, this RAPID project will research the ways in which teachers can plan universally designed and culturally relevant and responsive K12 STEM learning activities and environments.

    Community engaged research and public scholarship is included in the IU 2030 Strategic Plan. There are unstructured records of community engaged partnerships and projects in a dispersed range of data sources. Expanding community engaged and public scholarship in IU 2030 as a set of measurable objectives requires all efforts be identified, tracked, and supported. Building upon work accomplished through a 2024 Faculty Assistance in Data Science project, this semester-long project will explore and identify appropriate approaches three necessary tasks: transforming unstructured texts to usable data, machine learning classification algorithms to better categorize projects, and storing attributes of the project in a database.
