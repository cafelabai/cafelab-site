AI, like the printing press and internet, is a transformative "general-purpose technology." While typical AI development prioritizes breadth and generalization to make it bigger and better, we focus on depth and local relevance to make it more responsive and directed. By collaborating with communities, we create equitable, impactful AI that empowers people to shape technologies reflecting their values.
