AI is a "general purpose technology," a technology that has a profound impact on all aspects of society like the printing press and the internet. The typical approach to improving AI is through adding more data, making the technology more broad and more generalizable. Conversely, we believe that by focusing on depth, direction, and local relevance in collaboration with communities, AI can better meet the needs of educators and communities, fostering equitable and impactful outcomes. This localized, collaborative approach not only enriches AI's relevance but also empowers communities to shape technologies that reflect their values and aspirations.
