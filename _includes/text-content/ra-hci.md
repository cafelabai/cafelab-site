We leverage the multidisciplinary nature of human-computer interaction to focus on how different aspects of identity impact human lived experiences with interactive technologies. We used mixed research and design methods to investigate, to critique, and to design in these spaces. We primarily publish at HCI venues and you can find our work at ACM conferences such as CHI, CSCW, DIS, FDG, and CHI PLAY as well as games venues such as DiGRA and Meaningful Play.
