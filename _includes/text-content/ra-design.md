We utilize both critical design and transformational game design in the lab. Our critical design work seeks to highlight assumptions, exaggerate underlying dynamics, and investigate those ways that identity and technology interact. Our transformational game design work looks at how games as a powerful interactive medium can utilize research literature to impact game players through rich storytelling.
