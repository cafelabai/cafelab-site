<strong>Welcome to the CAFE Lab at Indiana University Indianapolis!</strong> We're a team of researchers, designers, and developers dedicated to creating AI tools for education that prioritize fairness, openness, and community involvement. We believe AI should be developed <em>with</em> communities, not just for them, so everyone can share in its benefits, with a particular focus on local needs and values.

Affiliated with the IUI Office of Community Engagement, our team brings together expertise from the School of Education, the Luddy School of Informatics, the School of Science, and the Herron School of Art + Design. Together, weâ€™re building AI solutions that reflect the diverse strengths and needs of our communities.
