<strong>Welcome to the CAFE (Community-Centered AI For Education) Lab at Indiana University Indianapolis!</strong> Our team of researchers, designers, and developers is dedicated to creating AI tools for education that prioritize fairness, openness, and community involvement. We believe AI should be developed <em>with</em> communities, not just for them, ensuring its benefits are shared by all, with a particular focus on local needs and values.

Affiliated with the IUI Office of Community Engagement, our team brings together expertise from the School of Education, the Luddy School of Informatics, the School of Science, and the Herron School of Art + Design. Together, weâ€™re building AI solutions that reflect the diverse strengths and needs of our communities.
