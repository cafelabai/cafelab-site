In our work we incorporate Critical Race Theory, Intersectionality, and Queer Theory as well as learnings from social justice activism and organizing spaces to study and design interactive technologies and games to empower and uplift people of color. We primarily use qualitative and design research methods to curate counternarratives and create counterspaces.
