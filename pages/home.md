CAFE Lab is an interdisciplinary research, design, and development group at Indiana University Indianapolis that focuses on the development and deployment of AI technologies that are equitable, transparent, and accountable to the communities they serve. Our research is motivated by the belief that AI technologies should be developed in collaboration with the communities they are intended to serve, and that the benefits of AI should be shared equitably among all members of society.

We are affiliated with the IUI Office of Community Engagement and represent a variety of disciplines from the School of Education, the Luddy School of Informatics, the School of Science, and the Herron School of Art + Design.
